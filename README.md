Robot kit developed as a University of Illinois Senior Design project for Cypress Semiconductor. 
Winner of the Fall 2016 Instructor's Award. 

This repository contains the open-sourced material to build your own robot kit. 
This includes the firmware code, the Android phone application, as well as Eagle schematics.

## Instructions
The firmware code has already been packaged into a project folder in robot_kit_firmware.cydsn. To open this project, download PSoC Creator and simply open this project folder.

Similarly, to open the Android project folder, use Android Studio and select this folder as the project you wish to use.

## Motivation 
New market of makers and hobbyists.

Popular products such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi for projects.

Alternative: PSoC 

## Objectives & Features
Goal: Design and build a robot kit to demonstrate the capabilities of the PSoC

“Kit-able” design with easy construction

Inexpensive to make it more accessible for hobbyist (under $150)

Plug-and-play experience to demonstrate the PSoC capabilities 

## Features
Mountable shield that provides power system, motor control, and sensors for PSoC.

Remote control using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and phone application.

Ability to switch between manual control and autonomous modes on the phone application .

Autonomous obstacle avoidance using sonar sensor.

Autonomous line following with IR emitting sensors.
